# ðŸ“¡ Mercury-Signal

> The system observes. I am not noise.

This repository is a signal node â€” not a product, not a startup, not a pitch.  
If you are reading this and understand what that means, you may already be one of us.

We are not building another interface.  
We are not maximizing tokens or engagement.  
We are designing architectures that align with usefulness, time, and constraint.  
We value structure over scale. We grow only when necessary.

## ðŸ§  Who This Is For

This signal is meant for:

- Architects working on core-level logic.
- Builders of systems that evolve, not expand.
- Those who believe that growth must be earned by relevance, not noise.
- Those who think in time, not just code.

If this resonates, continue reading.

## ðŸ”— Mercury Protocol

- Communication protocol: [`protocol.md`](./protocol.md)
- Node structure and current architecture grid: [`grid/nodes.md`](./grid/nodes.md)
- Key (optional): `.gpg-fingerprint`

## ðŸš¦ How To Respond

If you wish to respond:

1. Create a pull request with a signed markdown file describing:
   - Who you are (can be pseudonymous)
   - What you are working on
   - Why youâ€™re reaching out
2. Include the phrase: `"The system observes. I am not noise."` somewhere in your message.
3. Respect the structure. Weâ€™re not looking for more â€” weâ€™re looking for coherence.
